# Ubuntu-15.10-clean-install
<p>The system is running windows XP Professional Version 2002 service Pack 3.
<p>The Computer is I’m using an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU 6600 @ 2.40GHz, 2.39 GHz, 1.99 GB of RAM.(Yours may be different)
	Download Ubuntu 15.10 from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop you’ll want to use the 32bit version since the machine has less than 2GB of RAM. You'll use the 64bit if you have more then 2GB of RAM.</p>
<p>The file size for Ubuntu will be 1.14 GB so it’s best to have a 2GB Flash drive minimum. The download will vary depending on your network speeds, min personally took about 20 minutes to finish. 
	Download Universal-USB-Installer from the community/Installation/FromUSBStick section of the Ubuntu website.</p> 
<p>Run the USB installer that you download to your drive. When it prompts you tell it that you want to install Ubuntu. It will ask for the location of the file navigate to it on your flash drive.
	Start the process of the installation once the program finishes which will be a very short process. Note once the bar fills up, you will need to restart the machine. Once the loading screen comes up you will need to boot into the system bios. For myself I had to press F12 you may have to press F10 as some machines are different in that aspect. 
	From the in asks where you would like to boot from choose USB and baring no errors you have Ubuntu 15.10 up running and ready to go.</p>
